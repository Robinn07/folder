1. Class and Obj (example)

2. Class has data/attribute and func/methods
   > Code walkthrough
   > attributes get called itself, methods are called manually

3. Why Python is called OOP? – everything in Python is an object (data structure, data type etc)

4. Advantages of OOPS:
   > You can create your own datatype
   > code reusability
   > debugging
   > easy to colab

5. End to end chatbook
   > function vs method
   > magic method or dunder method  
   > self  
   > You can create attribute outside class as well  

   -> encapsulation  
   -> getter and setter  
   -> static method  

6. Inheritance  
   -> Inheritance code example  
   -> Why inheritance is needed? (code reuseability, parent has no access to child class)  
   -> what gets inherited? - Constructor, Non private attributes, Non private methods  
   -> constructor overloading & method overloading  
   -> Super keyword (can be used only inside class, can not access variables/attributes, used only inside child class)  

   > Types of inheritance - 1. Single Inheritance | 2. Multilevel | 3. Hierarchical | 4. Multiple <Diamond Problem> | 5. Hybrid
